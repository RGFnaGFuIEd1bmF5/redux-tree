# Redux Tree View Challange
React redux tree view challange.

Wrote the dummy server for handling the actions
and async simulation on server side.
It might be handling all events in some source and 
proceed it one by one to avoid from SPOF.
And it could be use some db.


### Usage
```sh
 npm i
 // For client
 npm start
 
 // For server
 npm run server
```
